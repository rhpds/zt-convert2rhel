== Understanding the Convert2RHEL command

There are several different combinations of arguments that can be used
to execute the conversion process. The main factor is registering your
new RHEL system with an active subscription. Your choices are:

[arabic]
. Fully interactive session: answer questions and input username and
password as part of the conversion
. Including your username and password in the convert2rhel command. This
is less desireable since your Red Hat customer portal credentials would
then be stored in the server’s Bash history in plain text.
. Including your organization ID and Activation Key as part of the
command. This is more secure, however, finding your org-id and creating
an activation key are outside the scope of this lab.

== Running the Convert2RHEL analyze utility

In order to automate this process as much as possible, you will kick off
the conversion analysis using the activation key combination from #3
above:

[source,bash,run]
----
convert2rhel analyze --org 12451665 --activationkey convert2rhel -y
----

____
*Note:* This process will take some time!

You’ll be asked to confirm several the process at several steps. Type a
`+y+` and hit enter to continue the process.

=== Reviewing the analysis

When the analysis process is complete, you will noticed a couple of
errors. The `+Error+` refers to an out of date kernel. This is listed as
an error and shown in red beacuse the conversion has a much higher level
of risk. The report even provides you the steps needed to correct this
issue.

You man also see an error similar to this:

To remediate this issue, enter the following command:

[source,bash,run]
----
yum update -y && reboot
----

The terminal will lose connection with the centos host leaving the
message `+exited+`.

You can reconnect the session in the `+centos+` tab if desired. Refresh
the `+centos+` tab until you are reconnected.

[!NOTE] Optional: Once your system is back from its reboot, you may
re-run the analyze command to see the results after fixing the kernel
version.
